# 0000  Gap year oral:

# For my gap year, I want to go to the United States. I choose the United States, because my uncle lives there, and I want to improve my English level.

# I will take my plane on Monday July 19 and stay there 6 months, and come back on Sunday December 19

# My uncle lives in Morristown, near New York, approximately an hour by car, I would live in my uncle's house in the cellar.

# I'll do some programming. I have a project that I want to start, which is to build an online store, and I found a little job at the donut shop next to where my uncle lives.

# To pay this I am counting on a small bank loan, and I do not have to pay too much because it is my uncle's house, I will pay for the food with the money I get from the donut shop, the Bank loan will pay the flight and other things.
