# Anglais/Texte gap year

**J - Hi!**
S - Hi! 
**J - Would you mind taking a minute to answer some questions for BBC News?**
S - Sure thing!
**J - Great! One question before though, have you done a gap year?**
S - I have!

**J - Amazing! Could you tell us a bit about what you did during this period?**
S - Oh, yeah. I mostly spent that time going on a vacation to France! I learned a lot about their culture and their way of living. I’m planning on moving there after my studies here in Britain, because there might be some job opportunities waiting for me. 

**J - Oh, cool! What are those job opportunities you’re talking about? What are you currently studying? **
S - Oh, I’m glad you asked! I’m currently studying industrial design, more specifically about nuclear power. I find the science behind it fascinating, and I’ve heard that France is a lot more open-minded about this subject, because it’s one of the safest ways of producing energy. And France is the country that produces most of its energy from it, so I believe there might be a lot of job opportunities.

**J - Very interesting, so you’re more of an engineer guy. What would you say was the most fulfilling thing about your gap year?**
S - Hmmm, I would say it’s probably the amount of stuff I learned. There’s a lot of subtle things that you don’t necessarily learn in school, small habits and expressions that French people use daily without thinking about it. 

**J - If you could retake a gap year, would you do it again?**
S - If I could, I wouldn’t take a gap year every year, because otherwise I wouldn’t study. But if I could take it I would do it about every 4-5 years, when I have a job. 

**J - Would you recommend this to another student? **
S - I sure as hell would! It was probably one of the most fulfilling years I ever spent as a student. It’s also a very nice break from the stress caused by exams.

**J - What are some things that maybe weren’t as good, that you would warn to anyone that wants to take a gap year?**
Well, first off, if you were very invested into your studies, after the gap year, you might lose all that momentum, and some students realize that they’re an entire year behind everyone else. It’s also really easy to waste a lot of time, and fall into procrastination and laziness. The scariest moment during my gap year was when I realized that the most productive thing I had done during the last 2 weeks was watching a Netflix series. 

**J- So, doing a gap year must be expensive, right?**
S- Yes, it is expensive because you must pay for food, housing, and travelling. You can solve this problem by working or taking internships, but it’s quite hard to obtain, especially as a student. I’m afraid you’ll have to save up some money for a few years before taking a gap year.

**J- Did you lose any of your friends from school when you were taking your gap year?**
S- Yes, I did lose some of my friends, but I still keep contact with some of them, and I also made new friends in France. But it’s okay, that’s just how life is.

**J- You said it was possible to be a year behind; how did you manage to catch up?**
S- I planned ahead that if I didn’t study at all during my gap year, I might end up in a very bad situation. So I studied during my trip in France, regularly. That’s why I could still catch up with classes afterwards.

**J- What are some tips you would give to anyone taking a gap year?**
S- Some tips I can give would be first, don’t lose your time, find a job to sustain yourself, study by yourself, speak with other people, spend your money wisely.

**J- Alright, thank you for your time, we hope to see you soon on BBC news.**
S- It’s a pleasure.
