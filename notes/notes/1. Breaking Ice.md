## Doc 2: Reading Activity

This document comes from a trust worthy internet site called [History.com](http://history.com). It was published in 2009 but it refers to an older story that took pace on October 30th (thirtieth) in the USA 

During a radio play, Orson Welles announced unexpected news: there had been explosions on Mars and a large meteor had landed in a Farmer's Field in New Jersey 

This was an intentional manipulation or hoax on the radio organized by a famous `named Orson Welles.`
